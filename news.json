You will get up to 2000 messages each day and up to 12 images per day. We are excited to offer Brainbase Premium as a way for our users to take their Brainbase experience to the next level. Whether you&#39;re a power user who wants to chat all day or an artist looking for inspiration to create stunning images, Brainbase Premium has got you covered. And don&#39;t forget, if you ever run out of messages, you can always save your conversation or purchase a message count re-fill for only $5! (applies to both standard and premium accounts)</p>\n<p>Upgrade to Brainbase Premium today and see what possibilities await you. Thank you for choosing Brainbase as your platform of choice, and happy messaging!</p>\n","author":"Gavin @ Brainbase"}]
